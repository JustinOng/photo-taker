This is a quick script designed to control a Marlin-based 3D printer with a USB-microscope mounted in place of the hot end. The camera will be moved in the positive X and Y axis by default, so position the camera at the bottom left corner of the item of interest.

Web Serial is used to connect to the 3D printer directly to command it to move the hotend, while WebRTC is used to connect to the webcam and take photos.
